An Etch-A-Sketch-like project where hovering one's mouse over the boxes in a grid 
causes them to change to a random color and revisiting that box increases the opacity.
Resize and Reset buttons are present in the header, allowing users to specify a new 
grid size via prompt (from 1 to 100 boxes per side) or to reset the grid back to the
default 16 x 16.

This was a very fun project, my confidence with flexbox and DOM manipulation are growing
and I think it shows here. This project took considerably less time than the 
rock-paper-scissors project where I spent most of my time learning DOM manipulation.

The extra credit goal of this project was to make the opacity fade in fluidly over
10 seconds. I could not quite get the timing right, so the opacity only increases when
revisiting the box. I would like to return to this in the future once I know how to
fix that.
